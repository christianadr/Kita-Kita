# Kita-Kita
OpenCV Hackathon Project

Official submission of 16 Bits PH for the OpenCV Hackathon.

<b>Problem Statement</b>

People who are visually impaired are most likely to experience restrictions in their independence, mobility, and educational achievements.  
In addition, they are also vulnerable to falls, fractures, injuries, and accidents (Welp A. et al., 2016).

<b>Solution to the Problem</b>

With this, 16 Bits PH introduces new technology-advanced assistance for people who are visually impaired. Kíta Kitá which is based on the Filipino 
phrase “nakita kita”, which means “I see you”, is an artificial intelligence that uses computer vision and has an optimized guiding system for 
assisting the visually impaired in their mobility.
